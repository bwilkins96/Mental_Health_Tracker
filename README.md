# Overview
This is a mental health tracker app that I created as the final project for SWDV 620: Web Applications at Maryville University. This project uses Django 4.2.2.

The main purpose of my app is for a user to be able to log information about their mental health at a given time. The user can then view a list of their logs, as well as a homepage with an overview of their recent logs. 

# To run
pip install Django==4

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver [localhost port]
